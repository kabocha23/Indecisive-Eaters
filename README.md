This web application allows you to search the yelp API by food category and location, although if you or your friends are particularly indecisive individuals, this app will randomly pick for you! Search as many restaurants you prefer, and drag them to the right side of the screen. When you're satisfied with your options, click Decide to have the computer pick an option for you. No more arguing!

This project was started during a 24 hour hackathon at our coding bootcamp. I really wanted to complete this project, as we weren't able to to do so within the given time.
